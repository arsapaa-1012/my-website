            <p class="sectag">Since humans began living in cities more than 6,000 years ago, they’ve had to address the same problems: sanitation, crime, congestion, tax collection, maintenance of public facilities, and emergency services. In addition, important technological innovations require infrastructure: the electric grid; telephone and cell-phone networks; internet (including fiber optic and cable networks); hot and cold running water; water and waste treatment; garbage and recycling removal; public parks and recreation facilities; rail, light rail, and automotive streets, roads, thoroughfares, and rights-of-way.

          <p class="sectag">The dramatic peaks of Dammastock and the snow-clad majestic summit of Matterhorn have always amazed and left hikers spellbound with its astonishing beauty. Matterhorn is 10th tallest amongst the several mountains of the world with a distinct feature of a well-defined pyramid shape. It is one of the most active fold mountains of the world and is featured on the world famous Toblerone Chocolate as its logo. The slopes of the Switzerland mountains are famous for the skiing and snowboarding activities. This is amongst the famous mountains in the world.</p>

          <p class="secsubtag">Spring is one of the four Earth’s seasons, that goes after winter and foreshadows summer. In this time of the year, days become longer and the weather better, warmer. Coming of spring means rebirth. Rebirth of nature, a lot of animals wake up from the hibernation and have breeding period. Also a lot of birds return to their homes, because of good temperatures.

            Spring season means more outdoors walking and spending time outside, on nature, and also this time of a year is best for meditation: forget about worries, clean your mind and just concentrate on beauty and sound of nature.
